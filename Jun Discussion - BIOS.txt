jun discussion about bios

Apparently BIOS loads some very basic interrupt vectors in. What are them?  What do you think are the reasons other interrupts are not widely 
supported in BIOS?
Some basic interrupt vectors the BIOS loads are video, disk, serial port, and keyboard. My assumption regarding why other interrupts are not
 widely supported is similar to Jacks answer. These interrupts are, I would assume, most common therefore the space reserved in the RAM should be for those.
 It would not make sense to waste space in the 1KB for an uncommon interrupt that is not widely used. 

2. In class, your professor argued OS is not responsible for saving/restoring registers of the interrupted process during interrupt handling. 
Although the conclusion may be correct, one argument your professor made is that interrupts could exist before any OS was introduced. 
This is intentionally debatable. Please defeat your professor by arguing BIOS works sort of like an OS and should be treated as one. 
The more fierce, the better.
