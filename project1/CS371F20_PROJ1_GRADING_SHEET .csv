"For Q&A tasks, fill your answers in the cell, or at least fill “A”, “P” or “N” in all the ”Your self-evaluation” cells. 
A-all finished   P-Partially finished  N-None finished
If you mark the task “N”, it receives 25% of max possible points for the task (It does not apply to extra-point tasks).
If you leave it blank, it receives 0 points. 
If your mark the task ""A"" or ""P"" but zero work is done for the task, then it receives 0 points.
Please leave ""score"" cells blank for course staff
If your code does not build,  your code will not receive more than 50% of max possible points",,,,,,,

[3] brk(): changes data segment size; noted to avoide considering malloc() is the more ""comfortable"" way of allocating memory.",0,,4,,
"In lecture, we discussed how C library translates a C lib function such as open to sys_open. It is easy to understand how this works for a C program. However, does this still apply to Java programs? State your reasoning with evidence.",4,"Yes, this applies to Java programs as well. We discussed in class User Land vs. Kernel Land and library functions are implemented in user mode and are then translated to be implemented in kernel mode. The evidence is shown in the checked in trace file for the C on line 34 and the Java trace file on line 2941 with the write() sys call on both. The Java file has a list of system calls just like that of the C file - system calls are the only way that an OS allows access to the program.",0,,4,,
