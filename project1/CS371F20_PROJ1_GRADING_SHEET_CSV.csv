"For Q&A tasks, fill your answers in the cell, or at least fill “A”, “P” or “N” in all the ”Your self-evaluation” cells. 
A-all finished   P-Partially finished  N-None finished
If you mark the task “N”, it receives 25% of max possible points for the task (It does not apply to extra-point tasks).
If you leave it blank, it receives 0 points. 
If your mark the task ""A"" or ""P"" but zero work is done for the task, then it receives 0 points.
Please leave ""score"" cells blank for course staff
If your code does not build,  your code will not receive more than 50% of max possible points",,,,,,

Is constructor implemented correctly? ,5,,0,"MyMemoryAllocation misses majority of functionalities. The development has been focused on MyLinkedList. 
There are several design issues in the MyLinkedList. Missing major functionalities of mayMerge/splitMayDelete/insertMayCompact. 
General suggestion is to 1. start with a int linked list from scratch, and design it correctly with right Node class, fully testing basic
Functionalities of it including iterator. 2. Once int linked list is done, replace data from int to block. 3. add splitMayDelete and 
insertMayCompact to block list.

In the meantime, the other members should be focusing on developing FF/NF/BF policy in allocator with being blocked by
List implementation – using ArrayList<Block> from Java to mimicry the list we need can help you to develop allocator in
Parrellel, and once MyLinkedList is ready, you can swap it in to replace Java standard list (which is not allowed to use in your final code)
